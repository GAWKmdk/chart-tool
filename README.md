# Chart Tool

Chart Tool is a platform for creating, storing and displaying beautiful, responsive embeddable charts. Designed to fit the needs of a fast-paced digital and print newsroom, Chart Tool generates charts in several formats:  

* **SVGs** that are both responsive and interactive, via an embed code
* **JPGs and PNGs** for use as thumbnails and sharing on social media
* **PDFs** that can be almost immediately dropped into a print content management system

## How does it work?

Chart Tool is made up of two parts:

**A back end interface** for storing data, setting up your chart, generating a static embed code and exporting charts, powered by [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). Embed codes are static by design — if your back end goes down, all the charts on your site will still display properly. [Try out a demo of the charts interface]().


**A front-end JavaScript and CSS library** that parses embed codes generated by the back-end and renders a responsive chart on your website using [D3.js](http://d3js.org). The front-end library also offers several API methods that can be accessed to modify charts before or after they've been drawn. [Check out some some example charts on our website]().


## Examples and demo

Examples of the types of charts Chart Tool can generate can be found [here]().

For a demo of the back end interface used to generate charts, images and PDFs, check out our [demo app]().

## Getting started

Curious to try out Chart Tool, but don't want to go through the process of setting it up? Try out our [hosted demo version]().

First, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= 4.1.0 installed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to keep your Node version in sync with what Chart Tool expects. This is important: anything lower and Meteor will fail in spectacular and unexpected ways.

Next, you'll need to [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

You'll also need [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

```sh
$ npm install -g gulp
```

Then, clone the Chart Tool repo and install your NPM dependencies, which will make sure Gulp is set up and can run your project:

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] && cd chart-tool
$ npm install
```

After that, you'll need to do `cd meteor && meteor` to get Meteor running for the first time, which provisions the Mongo database and installs all the dependencies it'll need (this might take a minute). After that, you're in business. Stop the Meteor server (`CTRL-C` on a Mac), `cd` back to the parent directory and pick one of the Gulp commands below.

* `gulp`: Default command, will start up both a Gulp.js and a Meteor.js server for development. Equivalent to running `gulp lib-serve && gulp meteor-serve`.
* `gulp meteor-serve`: Starts up a local Meteor instance of the interface at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and watches for file changes.
* `gulp lib-serve`: Starts up a local BrowserSync instance of the frontend at [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) and watches for file changes.
* `gulp meteor-build`: Builds the back end into a tarball in the `/dist/`, ready for deployment to a server.
* `gulp lib-build`: Build the static assets for the front-end library into the `/dist` folder.
* `gulp buildver`: Returns the buildVer variable present in package.json. Optionally, accepts a `set` argument which edits the buildVer value. For instance, `gulp buildver --set=12` will set the buildVer in package.json to "12". Used for tracking build versions during the deployment process.


## Making a chart

A full tutorial on how to make a chart, export it in several different file types and embed it on the web is [available here](https://github.com/globeandmail/chart-tool/blob/master/tutorials/first-chart.md).


## API

Chart Tool offers a front-end API for manipulating charts and data before, during, and after a chart has been drawn. A full tutorial and set of methods for the API is [available here](https://github.com/globeandmail/chart-tool/blob/master/tutorials/api.md).
