# Making your first chart

<!-- First, make sure you're all set up by following the **Getting started** steps in our [README](https://github.com/globeandmail/chart-tool/blob/master/README.md).

Now that you're up and running, it's time to make a chart. Head on over to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you'll see two fields: one for a slug, and another for your data.

Chart Tool accepts data in CSV and TSV formats.
