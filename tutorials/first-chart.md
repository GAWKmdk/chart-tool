# Making your first chart

<!-- First, make sure you're all set up by following the **Getting started** steps in our [README](https://github.com/globeandmail/chart-tool/blob/master/README.md).

Chart Tool accepts data in CSV and TSV formats. 

Exporting for web, social media, and print -->

Once you have a local copy of Chart Tool running you're ready to make a chart.

1. ##Open the Chart Tool [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you're greeted with two fields##

	* **slug** to identify the chart. Include date, section, topic, etc. as per your newsroom convention
	* **data** to draw the chart. Chart Tool accepts comma and tab-delimited data (CSV and TSV) copied directly from a spreadsheet or text file. 

	**Data must only be the columns and rows you want drawn in the chart.**

	* Unexpected _non-data_  entered into the data field will cause the chart to render incorrectly or not at all. Non-data includes units (e.g., $, %) and any comma-formatting. 
	* Additional information including title, qualifier, source, units, etc. can be added to the chart afterwards. 

	####Sample data#####
	Columns and rows of plain delimited data. Notice the irregular frequency of the data.

	| Year | Coal | Oil  | Gas |
	|------|------|------|-----|
	| 1990 | 1942 | 308  | 28  |
	| 2013 | 7187 | 1193 | 311 |
	| 2020 | 7313 | 1440 | 544 |
	| 2025 | 6962 | 1517 | 692 |
	| 2030 | 6499 | 1559 | 840 |


2. ##Enter a suitable slug and paste in your delimited data. Click **Create chart**.##

3. ## Line charts by default##

	Chart Tool initially tries to create a line chart with your data and may not recognize your date format. 	You might see a Chart error. Fear not. 

	* If the data is a time series change the Date format pulldown to match your data (e.g., YYYY). 
	* Try changing the Chart type from Line to one of the other options. Columns are reliable.
	* You can stack columns or area charts with multi-series data.
	* If you still get errors always **check your data**.	

	You have a chart. Now it needs some context.

4. ##Add some chart context to help your readers## 
	
	* Double-click on the chart title line and enter a meaningful title. 
	* Double-click on the ''CHART TOOL' text  below the chart to add source information.
	* Use the chart qualifier line to add a units label to the y-axis.

5. ##Adjust settings and style## 

	Click on a heading to expand the options within.

	* Set the X-axis scale to suit your data
		* **Time:** 
		* **Ordinal:** 
		* **Ordinal-Time:**

	* Set the Y-axis to suit your data
		* **Formatting:** Prefix, Suffix and number formatting
		* **Custom range** Chart Tool sets the range based on your data -- with a little added for breathing room up top. You can change the y-axis max by entering a number in the **Custom range** field    .
		* **Ticks** Change the number of ticks that appear on the y-axis. Chart Tool may override or round up your setting for better display.
		* **Niceify**
		* **Rescale**

	* Tags let Chart Tool filter charts within the admin interface. Use them if your team lives for taxonomy. 
	* Set chart styling to primary (default) or alternate. This depends on what's defined in your Chart Tool config. 
		
		Multi-series area or column charts can also be stacked for compact display and comparison across series. 
	* There are a few additional options available for your chart including:
		* **Share data** let users download a CSV of your dataset
		* **Social sharing** users can post an image of your chart to Facebook, Twitter or share by email and SMS. 
		
		**Social sharing requires AWS for image storage. See [Setting up chart thumbnails
](thumbnails.md)**

		* **Show tips** let users see the exact values for a point on your chart. Handy for dense datasets.



6. ##Publish your chart## 

	Copy the embed code and add it to your CMS or HTML page. To deploy a Chart Tool chart your need the front-end JavaScript and CSS library on a public-facing server and linked to the HTML page that the chart appears on. 
	


7. ##Alternate formats##
	Aside from responsive SVGs, Chart Tool also generates static images of your charts in formats optimized for web and print. These can be useful if you don't have the front-end library in production, need to use the chart as a graphic within videos or another element, or need to hand off a chart to the print designers. 
	* **Web export** Available in common grid sizes, custom width and heights, and social images sized for Facebook and Twitter.
	* **Print export** An editable PDF ready for printing. Adjust the number of columns and lines to suit.
