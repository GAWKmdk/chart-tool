/*Right now the way the columns and stacked columns are classed in js,
there is a bit of a conflict. Columns series are zero indexed but they probably shouldn't be.
We should probably change this going forward.
The nesting of columns in groups is also slightly different in stacked/non-stacked which is
causing a more specific selector to be set for the non-stacked variant of the first series below.
